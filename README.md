User Profile (module for Omeka S)
==================================

> __New versions of this module and support for Omeka S version 3.0 and above
> are available on [GitLab], which seems to respect users and privacy better
> than the previous repository.__

[User Profile] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows to create new settings for
users, for example the phone, or the organisation. The settings are manageable
by the user in the standard admin form, in the site guest user form, or via the
rest api.


Installation
------------

Install optional modules [Guest] and [Generic].

Uncompress files and rename module folder "UserProfile".

See general end user documentation for [Installing a module].


Usage
-----

### Configuration

The fields are added via the config form of the module. The main option creates
a [Zend/Laminas form], so the the options are the one used to create html input
fields with a name, a type, attributes and options.

There are some specific option keys for each element:
- `exclude_admin_show` (default: `false`)
  Don't display the value in the admin user board.
- `exclude_admin_edit` (default: `false`)
  Forbid user to edit the value and don't append the element to the admin user
  form.
  When an element is not available in public or admin form, it's still available
  via api and settings and can be used to store any data.
- `exclude_public_show` (default: `false`)
  Don't display the value in the public user board (module Guest).
- `exclude_public_edit` (default: `false`)
  Forbid guest user to edit the value and don't append the element to the public
  user form (module Guest).
- `element_group` (default: `profile`)
  It is used by Omeka S v4 and allows to create fieldsets. You can create any
  dynamic groups you want. The default is `profile` so you don't need to set it.

Three formats are allowed: `ini`, `xml`, or `json`. Each format has pros and
cons. The format `ini` is more readable, `xml` is designed for experts and `json`
is more common.

The main point to check are the keys, but as long as you use standard keys, it's
not an issue. With the format `ini`, two characters are forbidden in keys : the
dot "`.`"  and the vertical apostrophe “`'`”. You can replace the last by a real
apostrophe “`’`” instead, but you cannot replace the dot. In that case, use
formats `xml` or `json`. With xml, the keys cannot contains space, greater sign
`>`, lower sign `<`, single `'` and double quote `"`". With json, some
characters should be escaped, and the data must be well formed, in particular
without trailing comma `,` on last key of each group.

- `ini`

See an example in [Omeka themes].

```ini
elements.userprofile_phone.name                                 = "userprofile_phone"
elements.userprofile_phone.type                                 = "Tel"
elements.userprofile_phone.options.element_group                = "profile"
elements.userprofile_phone.options.label                        = "Phone"
elements.userprofile_phone.attributes.id                        = "userprofile_phone"

elements.userprofile_organisation.name                          = "userprofile_organisation"
elements.userprofile_organisation.type                          = "Select"
elements.userprofile_organisation.options.element_group         = "profile"
elements.userprofile_organisation.options.label                 = "Organisation"
elements.userprofile_organisation.options.empty_option          = ""
elements.userprofile_organisation.options.value_options.none    = "None"
elements.userprofile_organisation.options.value_options.Alpha   = "Alpha"
elements.userprofile_organisation.options.value_options.Beta    = "Beta"
elements.userprofile_organisation.options.value_options.Gamma’s Delta = "Gamma’s Delta"
elements.userprofile_organisation.attributes.id                 = "userprofile_organisation"
elements.userprofile_organisation.attributes.class              = "chosen-select"
elements.userprofile_organisation.attributes.data-placeholder   = "Select an organisation…"
```

            "name": "userprofile_phone",
            "type": "Tel",
            "options": {

            }
        },

        "userprofile_organisation": {

            "attributes": {
                "id": "userprofile_organisation",
                "class": "chosen-select",
                "data-placeholder": "Select an organisation…"
            }
        }
    }
}
```


### Rest api

For rest api, use something like:

```sh
curl --data '{"o:email":"test.0001@test.com","o:name":"Test 0001","o:role":"researcher","o:is_active":true,"o:setting":{"locale":"fr","default_resource_template":"","userprofile_organisation":"Alpha"}}' --header "Content-Type: application/json" 'https://example.org/api/users?key_identity=xxx&key_credential=yyy'
```

Note that you need an [api credential key] to create, read, update, and delete
user data.


TODO
----

- [ ] Use the form validator in order to check any element.
- [x] In v4, allows to create dynamic group.
